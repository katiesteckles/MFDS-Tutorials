There are no answers for this exercise, as it is mainly about looking at the plots. A spreadsheet with the instructions followed is below.

(a) Which of the following datasets might you expect to follow a normal distribution?

You might expect a normal distribution from:
* Number of dollars spent annually by customers of a wholesale distributor, in thousands
* Length of raisins, in mm
* Relative performance of the FTSE index on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, each day in 2009
* Heart rates of patients at a maternity clinic in rural Bangladesh

You might not expect a normal distribution from:
* Scores attained by students from two different school sets on a test - this might not show a normal distribution if the attainment levels of the two sets is different
* Number sold in December 2010 for each item available in an online shop, sold in packs of 4 - this is counting a number of items, which might result in a lot of numbers being the same

(b) (Importing the CSV)

(c) For each dataset, plot the data on a histogram and decide whether you think this data is normally distributed. Can you match up the datasets to the list above?

* Dataset 1: Relative performance of the FTSE index on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, each day in 2009 (actual values ranged from -0.05 to 0.05, but have been scaled up and shifted so they are all positive)
* Dataset 2: Number sold in December 2010 for each item available in an online shop, sold in packs of 4 - does not display a normal distribution
* Dataset 3: Number of dollars spent annually by customers of a wholesale distributor, in thousands
* Dataset 4: Heart rates of patients at a maternity clinic in rural Bangladesh
* Dataset 5: Length of raisins, in mm (estimated using a machine learning algorithm from a photo of 900 raisins)
* Dataset 6: Scores attained by students from two different school sets on a test - has two separate groups so does not display a normal distribution

(a) $X \sim N(31, 2.1^2)$

 $$z = \frac{x - 31}{2.1}$$

&emsp;(i) $z = -1.05$; spreadsheet: $0.1474$; table: $1 - 0.8485 = 0.1515$

&emsp;(ii) $z = 0.24$; spreadsheet: $0.4059$; table: $1 - 0.5948 = 0.4052$

&emsp;(iii) $z = 0.95$; spreadsheet: $0.8295$; table: $0.8289$

&emsp;(iv) $z= -1.43$ and $z = -0.95$; spreadsheet: $0.0939$; table: $0.9236 - 0.8289 = 0.0947$


(b) $X \sim N(88, 13.7^2)$

$$z = \frac{x - 88}{13.7}$$

&emsp;(i) $z = -0.24$; spreadsheet: $0.4048$; table: $1 - 0.5948 = 0.4052$

&emsp;(ii) $z = -0.29$; spreadsheet: $0.6148$; table: $0.6141$

&emsp;(iii) $z = 0.07$; spreadsheet: $0.5291$; table: $0.5279$

&emsp;(iv) $z = -0.04$ and $z = 0.007$; spreadsheet: $0.0204$; table: 

$$P(X<88.1) - P(X\leq87.4) =  0.5040 - (1 - 0.5160)=  0.5040 - 0.4840 = 0.0200$$

(c) Let $X \sim N(10, 2.5^2)$ and $Y \sim N(50, 6.3^2)$. The given distributions are:

&emsp;(i) $2X \sim N(20, 5^2)$

&emsp;(ii) $3Y + 40 \sim N(190, 18.9^2)$

&emsp;(iii) $X+Y \sim N(60, 6.77^2)$

&emsp;(iv) No solutions are provided for this, as it is an exercise for you to see how the graphs compare.
