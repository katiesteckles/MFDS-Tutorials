There are no answers for this exercise, as it is mainly about looking at the plots. A spreadsheet with the instructions followed is below.

(a) Which of the following datasets might you expect to follow a normal distribution?

You might expect a normal distribution from:
* Number of dollars spent annually by customers of a wholesale distributor, in thousands
* Length of raisins, in mm
* Relative performance of the FTSE index on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, each day in 2009
* Heart rates of patients at a maternity clinic in rural Bangladesh

You might not expect a normal distribution from:
* Scores attained by students from two different school sets on a test - this might not show a normal distribution if the attainment levels of the two sets is different
* Number sold in December 2010 for each item available in an online shop, sold in packs of 4 - this is counting a number of items, which might result in a lot of numbers being the same

(b) (Importing the CSV)

(c) For each dataset, plot the data on a histogram and decide whether you think this data is normally distributed. Can you match up the datasets to the list above?

* Dataset 1: Relative performance of the FTSE index on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, each day in 2009 (actual values ranged from -0.05 to 0.05, but have been scaled up and shifted so they are all positive)
* Dataset 2: Number sold in December 2010 for each item available in an online shop, sold in packs of 4 - does not display a normal distribution
* Dataset 3: Number of dollars spent annually by customers of a wholesale distributor, in thousands
* Dataset 4: Heart rates of patients at a maternity clinic in rural Bangladesh
* Dataset 5: Length of raisins, in mm (estimated using a machine learning algorithm from a photo of 900 raisins)
* Dataset 6: Scores attained by students from two different school sets on a test - has two separate groups so does not display a normal distribution
