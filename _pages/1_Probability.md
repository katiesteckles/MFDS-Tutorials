In this week's tutorial, we will use techniques from probability to complete a mini-project.

(a) Download the CSV file linked below, and import it into a spreadsheet.

[![CSV icon](../_images/csv-icon.png)tut0-data1.csv](https://katiesteckles.github.io/MFDS-Tutorials/resources/tut1-data1.csv)

The data contains a list of stops on the Manchester Metrolink, with their station codes, fare zone and date of opening.

(b) Use a `=COUNTIF()` function or a filter to answer the following questions:

i) If I pick a tram stop on the Metrolink at random, what is the probability that it is in Zone 1?

ii) If I pick a tram stop on the Metrolink at random, what is the probability that it was opened before the year 2000?
