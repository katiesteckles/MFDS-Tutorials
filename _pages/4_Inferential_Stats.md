# Inferential Statistics

In this week's tutorial, we will use the techniques from the previous lecture to complete a mini-project. You should save any files you work on as spreadsheets, so you can refer back to them later.

(a) Load this [Sampling Distribution Simulator](https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/) in a browser window, then arrange it so you can see it alongside this page. Click the 'Begin' button in the top left so a yellow page loads.

(b) The top chart shows a normal distribution. Click and drag on the grey part of that chart to make a distribtion of your own design, of any shape.

(c) Click the 'Animated' button on the section below to take a sample of size 5 from your distribution and add its mean to the plot of sample means below. Repeat this a few times. Using the '5' button will add 5 samples at a time (without showing the individual values dropping in).

(c) Once you have become bored with doing this 5 samples at a time, click the '10,000' button to add 10,000 sample means, and observe that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution. Compare the mean of this distribution to the mean of your original population.

(d) Design a different distribution in the top plot using the mouse, and try this again.
